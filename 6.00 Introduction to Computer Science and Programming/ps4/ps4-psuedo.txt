Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:
    1. try 0,1, all the way to 26 as all possible shifts, for each shift, decode the cipher text to get a text
    2. count the number of word in the text
    3. find the shift giving the maximum number of word


Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:
    1. find the best shift of the text for which we can get valid word as many as possible before a invalid word, remember the position of first invalid word and the corrent shift
    2. recursitively do that as what to do in 1. until reach the end of text, for each recursion we start finding shift from the position we get from last step
